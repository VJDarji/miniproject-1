For this assignment, you must design and develop a program to read any CSV file and output an HTML table.  The program should be able to input any csv file with any number of fields and use the field headings in the CSV file's first row to become the table headings of the table. The program should output an HTML Bootstrap table with table headings and alternating zebra strips for rows.  Your program should demonstrate the use of classes, objects, static, class scopes (private, public, protected).  Your program is REQUIRED to use OOP programming techniques and demonstrate the DRY programming concept.  Your program must use static and object (properties and methods) properly.  Remember that objects are things and statics are actions.  You can think of objects as the subject of a sentence and the static methods as the verbs.
